# WayChess

## Goals

  - [x] Open source chess gui
  - [ ] Fully-featured (comments, variations, annotations, etc.)
  - [ ] Easy to install
  - [ ] Fluid design
  - [x] Cross-platform
  - [ ] Ease of use
  - [x] Modularity
  - [x] Database

## Progress

Navigation is controlled by keybindings instead of button right now. Comments, variations, and annotations have yet to be added. The chess.com database explorer (doesn't need to login) and the engine have been somewhat stably implemented.
